PHP shell
=========

It's a really simple interactive PHP shell.

Usage
-----

Just launch this PHP script and put PHP instructions and this script will execute them.

TODO List
---------

Things that still need to be done:

* More tests (also make PHPUnit tests)
* A way to separate variables of this script (so you couldn't use them from the program)
* A configuration file
* A way of defining functions and saving them
* Better User Interface (Readline like)
* Enabling usage of console and window programs from this shell (i.e. vim, mplayer, vlc)

Contributing
------------

You can contribute to this project by:

* generating a patch using git and sending it to me, or
* opening Pull Request on GitHub.

Just make sure that the changes that you're sending to me are in a separate branch.

Any kind of help is welcomed.
